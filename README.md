This repository houses the ChaosNative culture handbook and serves as the company's core repository of guidance.
Our company handbook, which is available in this repository, is open to the public as part of our commitment to transparency.

We look forward to hearing from you.

We started being more focused about culture by putting it on paper, by having discussions about it, dismantling it, polishing the pieces, then reassembling it.
