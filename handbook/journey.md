# Journey

ChaosNative has humble beginnings with the original team frantically searching for a suitable Chaos Engineering tool for their SaaS operations. We wrote our own chaos toolset and open sourced it, thus began the real journey of Cloud Native Chaos Engineering. There is a lot of road ahead to be covered and we will not stop till Developers and SREs feel they have an easy to use toolset and platform to implement their reliability goals.
We created LitmusChaos with the requirements of Cloud Native Chaos Engineering. We are on a mission to make the progressive resilience easy and realistic for both cloud native developers and SREs. Kubernetes developers and SREs use Litmus to create, manage and monitor chaos workflows by extending Kubernetes itself.
