# Chaotik

Our mascot, Chaotik, is inspired by the Tasmanian Devil. It is a loud and ferocious marsupial from the island of Tasmania.

Its tenacious and chaotic nature is something that is similar to the practice of Chaos Engineering, a process that thrives solely on creating chaos.
Chaotik may look all cute and cuddly on the surface but he is always plotting to cause mayhem. His mohawk reveals that he is a punk. Punks are considered as chaos agents of the society who rebel against the status quo by causing constant disruptions.
