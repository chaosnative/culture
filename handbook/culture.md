# Culture

We are making every effort to make chaos experiments ubiquitous and resilient themselves. We empower ourselves to listen to the resilience needs of enterprises and across a variety of industries and push that feedback directly into the tools or products we build or serve or services we deliver.

“Our goal is Creating a Culture That Drives Results” This document broadly emphasises the culture of ChaosNative and these three elements serve as a foundation for our culture.

### THREE BUILDING BLOCKS OF OUR CULTURE : 

### Empowerment

Employee empowerment is based on the idea that giving employees the resources, authority, opportunity and motivation to do their work, as well as holding them accountable for their actions, will make them happier and more proficient. Every employee at ChaosNative is empowered to innovate in open source, operate in a flat organization mode, commit to community development and attend to the needs of our customers. Employee empowerment in the workplace is a great way to improve employee engagement and retain your top talent. To support employees' performance, we help them find meaning at work, and understand how their jobs impact the business.

Employee Empowerment on the Organizational Level : When it comes to empowerment in the workplace, it's all about communicating the right messages to the right employees at the right time and in the right way.

Employee Empowerment on the Individual Level: When employees feel empowered and trusted, they: Are more willing to go the extra mile for the team and the business. Take ownership over their work. Generate ideas. Find meaning and purpose at work. Feel proud of the company they're working for.

### Ownership

Our culture encourages ownership of things that we are empowered to take. Blameless postmortems and retrospectives are the fundamental drivers of our motivation in the organization.

In a world of uncertainty, creating a culture of ownership among your employees can go a long way to helping them improve their financial well-being, build loyalty with the organization and become more productive, engaged workers.

By creating a culture where your employees are as invested in the organization’s success as you, great things can happen. Keeping employees engaged has always been difficult, but in today's job market, where skilled candidates are in high demand, it appears that retaining the best employees is more difficult than ever.Encouraging employees to take more initiative and create a culture of ownership, we have implemented the right tools such as the work management system Asana. This software helps automate work-tracking methodology .

Employees with a sense of ownership seek “creative and innovative ways to improve and develop what they are doing, rather than just going through the motions. Employees want to better understand the organization’s vision and objectives.Ownership is related to an employee taking initiative, coming up with his or her own ideas, and stating that he or she will accomplish a particular goal.

### Commitment

We commit to empower ourselves, attend to the open source community needs and the needs of our esteemed customers. We commit to making cloud native reliability easy to implement and observe.Everyone in the organization matters. This culture focuses on the relationship, usually emotional, between the organisation and its employees and how they work as a team, ensuring there are shared goals, values and behaviour.

At ChaosNative , we introduce employees to the Big picture: We as a company have a clear understanding of what success looks like and why the employees are doing what they are doing. Employees must sink in to the values and culture just as much as leaders do in order to behave in ways that are consistent with the organization's values.
