# Work Culture

### Remote Only
ChaosNative is a remote only company with team members working in different parts of the globe. ChaosNative’s remote-first culture allows you to choose when and where you live and work, your work can revolve around your life as opposed to the other way around.
Working remotely and leading a remote team may seem like a bizarre concept to many people who have worked in businesses that enable their workers to work from home  occasionally in case of emergency. We have learned to be more transparent and successful as a result of our experience running a company without a formal headquarters, as well as engaging with the open source and Kubernetes community, the physical limits of a location made no sense.

### Tools for remote working:

- Slack- We at ChaosNative, use slack for communication. With Slack Connect, admins can maintain control over their organisation's data and monitor external access. And unlike email – which leaves users open to the risk of spam and phishing , when they work in channels, teams receive messages and files only from verified members.

- Asana- With goals in Asana, your team now has a single source of truth for your shared objectives that's connected to the work to achieve them. Setting and tracking goals with Asana can boost your team's performance while ensuring your organization is focused on the right priorities to drive the results you want.

- Google Calendar- Google Calendar is an essential tool for planning time, thus for allowing people to schedule calls and meet each other. But also to allow for keeping your work-life balance in check.

To make a smooth transition to distributed/remote  work and continue building positive relationships with colleagues, you’ll likely have to redefine some things you used to take for granted and embrace new behaviors. Thankfully, we’re all capable of this. Some of our habits have already changed since working from home.


### Written standups:

A daily stand-up meeting is an essential element of sharing information. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:
- What others are doing (to stay in sync or minimise duplication, provide an opportunity to collaborate);
- Express dependencies (for example, I am waiting for another event to occur before I can continue working);
emphasising (semi-)important events, new projects, merge requests (doesn't replace email for important notifications, but helps with spreading the information);
- Highlighting relevant information sources (for example, stating an interesting meeting that occurred and where meeting minutes may be found, citing an intriguing article or task); status update on future plans (are we on track with our long-term goals, is some change in direction coming).

However, physical standups (round tables) are usually ineffective and difficult to follow, and they do not let you go further into issues that interest you. A physical standup also effectively prohibits anyone from a distant time zone from participating.

### Business Etiquettes:

Business etiquette is a set of rules that govern the way people interact with one another in business, with customers, suppliers, with inside or outside bodies. It is all about conveying the right image and behaving in an appropriate way.

### Meetings Étiquettes

### Email Etiquette

Email is essential to our work. You should use your company email primarily for work.
- Use in the workplace- You have complete freedom to utilise your business email for work-related activities. You can, for example, sign up for newsletters and online services that will assist you in your employment or professional development.
- Personal usage only- You can use your email for personal purposes as long as you keep it secure and avoid spamming or revealing sensitive information. You can, for example, send emails using emails to friends and family and download ebooks, guides and other safe content for your personal use.
