# Code Of Conduct
Our Employee Code of Conduct corporate policy specifies our expectations for employees' attitude  towards their coworkers, managers, and the firm as a whole. We advocate for free expression and open communication. However, we require all employees to adhere to our code of conduct. They should refrain from offending, engaging in significant arguments, or disturbing our workplace. We also anticipate that they will promote a well-organized, courteous, and collaborative workplace.

### Confidentiality and data protection

- Always keep private information buckled or safe.
- When confidential documents are no longer required, discard them.
- Make sure that you only access private and sensitive data on secure devices.
- Only share information with other employees when it is absolutely required and permitted.
- Unless absolutely essential, keep private data on our business premises.

### Harassment Free Workplace

To create a pleasant and effective workplace, everyone must behave decently with others and make them feel secure. Each of us should do our share to avoid workplace harassment.
Harassment is a wide word that can encompass seemingly innocuous activities such as gossip. We can't provide a complete list, but here are some examples of harassment:
- [Intentionally sabotaging someone's job.]
- [Participating in frequent or unwelcome approaches of any kind.]
- [Commenting disparagingly on someone's ethnic origin or religious beliefs.]
- [Starting or spreading rumours about a person or thing]

If you are being harassed, you can talk either of these two people:

- HR
- Reporting Manager

### Social Media

You can access your personal accounts at work. However, we expect you to behave professionally, in accordance with our policies and to remain productive. We specifically request that you:

- Self-control is essential. Avoid being distracted by your social media sites.
- Make it clear to others that your personal account or claims do not represent our organisation. For instance, add a disclaimer like "opinions are my own."

Avoid disclosing intellectual property (trademarks, for example) or sensitive information. Before you reveal unannounced corporate news, check with your manager or public relations.
