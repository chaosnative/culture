# Vision

Our vision is to enable cloud native DevOps to approach the reliability of cloud native applications with the tool sets that are easy to use, scalable and yield desired results within a short period of time. We aim to increase the bar of DevOps experience against failures that can occur in product by helping reduce the recovery time, increase the gap between failures and finally reduce the cost of failures to the customer business.

# Mission

Our mission is to build a widely used open source chaos engineering platform LitmusChaos for the cloud native community.
